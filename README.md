# GameModeControl

* * *

A powerful lightweight plugin that helps you organizing game modes on your server.

## Are you using GameModeControl?

... then I would appreciate it, when you send me some feedback (in form of a pm or in the comments).

**Download GameModeControl for all your servers:** for 1.7 and below: **_Beta 1.0_**; for 1.8 and above use **_the newest version._**
 I'm not going to make a bug-free version for 1.7 servers, because there are too few servers that do NOT run on 1.8.

Current development stage: BETA 1.3.1

## Commands

**Help**:

*   <> = required
*   [] = optional
*   1 | 2 = 1 or 2, but not both
*   gmc.<_permission_> = permission to change your own and the gamemode of other players
*   gmc.<_permission_>.self = you are only allowed to change your own gamemode
*   gmc.<_permission_>.others = you have the permission to change the gamemode of other players

/survival [player] | Change the gamemode of a player to survival | _gmc.survival[.self | .others]_ |

| /gmi | Shows information about GMC, such as the version | _gmc.gmi_ |
| /gmr | Reloads the whole server in order to reload the config of GMC | _gmc.gmr_ |

<small>* overrides the standard '/gamemode' from mojang; you can still use /mojang:gamemode for the "normal" /gamemode command.</small>

## Installation

1.  Copy the file you have <a>download</a>ed into your "plugins"-folder
2.  Restart your server, then stop it
3.  Edit the 'config.yml' and set the messages you want
4.  Start your server and enjoy

## Configuration

If you want to reset the config, just delete the 'config.yml' file (in <your plugins folder>/GMC/). GMC will generate it on server startup.

## ToDo list

*   A function which allows players to change their gamemode only once
*   A function which allows changing the gamemode temporary (e.g. until the player leaves the server)
*   Please send me a [pm](http://dev.bukkit.org/home/send-private-message/?to=MCMainiac), post a comment or use the [github issues system](https://github.com/MCMainiac/GameModeControl/issues) and add the label 'enhancement' to it to suggest a feature
