# GameModeControl

* * *

A powerful lightweight plugin, which changes the gamemode of a player.

## Are you using GMC?

...then I would appreciate it when you give me some feedback! I want to know what you think about GMC. Thanks for every response in form of a comment or a pn!

For game version 1.5+ you can use GMC Beta 1.0.0\. For 1.8+ use GMC Beta 1.2.0.

I am searching for people who can test the permissions, make tutorials and such things! Please send me a pn!

Thanks for over 1,500 downloads!

## To-do list

Here are some features, which I want to add:

*   A function which allows a player to change his or her gamemode only once.
*   Change a gamemode temporary
*   Add a "gmc.gm.others" permission

## Bugs

If you change the gamemode of another player you won't recieve the players name. Instead there would be %player.  

Well I hope you'll enjoy my little plugin and I'll make it more powerful and work off the to-do list.

Thanks :)
